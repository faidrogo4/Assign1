# Assign1
Uploaded files and folders in this repository are contents that are used for the website hosted in Assignment 1 CS4843.

# Overview
This website is deployed using S3 and CloudFront on AWS. S3 is designed to store contents of a project and make that project accessible to different types of AWS services. S3 also allows for static website hosting which is enabled for this project. The bucket the contents are stored in is set to public and its bucket policy is updated. CloudFront is a content delivery network that allowed us to deploy this website globally and cache its contents in edge locations. This improves the read performance of the website.
